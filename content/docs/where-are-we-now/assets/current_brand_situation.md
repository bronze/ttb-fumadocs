## What it is:

A distillation of the brand's current relationship with consumers, based upon Brand Assessor Research and Brand Asset evaluation.

## What its for:

The Current Situation articulates where the brand is now, so that you can go on to suggest what changes in the brand's relationship require changing. It is written as if the brand is alive, as if it is a living creature with a relationship, character, personality and ability to communicate.

## How to do it:

Firstly, set down your observations about the brand's essential appeal. How does it appeal to reason; the senses; the emotions? Does it convey any special benefits in user identity from its purchase? Does it make the user feel smarter, younger, fresher, more respected, etc.?

Then try to define its personality. What characteristics does it convey? Is it showy, practical, concerned, romantic, wild, serious, kindly, etc.? Avoid clich√às and easy answers. Use the consumer's words and drawings to help make these colourful and less trite. Make the personality as unique as a brand should be. If you personify the brand, don't only use famous people, use animals, places, famous buildings- any creative metaphor which is distinctive.

What sort of person appreciates the brand? Not only demographics, lifestyle and life-phase, but what kind of character do they have? Are they careful, anarchic, experimental, etc. What are their dreams? What are their nightmares?

What relationship do they have with the brand? Is it a friend or a stranger? Is it like your mother or father? Do you always go along with the brand, or do you go your own way? Are you a loyal friend or champion?

Why is the brand different from the competition? Does it offer something different in the buying or owning? Does it work differently? How does it measure up? How does the brand communicate now? What is the brand known for in its communication? Is it famous; if so for what? Is it infamous; if so for what?
