## What it is:

It is a proprietary way of assessing a brand's current value and image with consumers; a rigorous and objective but deep and qualitative assessment based on direct, first hand consumer data that builds on but goes beyond mere "collective wisdom and opinion".

## What its for:

We need it because often existing research will have been done without these specific questions in mind; because often exclusively quantitative methodologies will have been used throwing up just "nice-to-know" but unhelpful sort of data; because often there will be several schools of thought; and finally because often we tend to either grossly overestimate or underestimate the brand's value.

The findings of the BrandAssessor Research should be summarised into a single-page output format called [Current Brand Situation](../assets/current_brand_situation/). Ideally this should in fact be taken one step further to see if we can capture all this data in the form of _vivid, visual snapshot_ that encapsulates the brand's status quo.

## How to do it

BrandAssessor Research can only be done by an experienced qualitative researcher. The better the researcher, the greater the value will be.

## Research Briefing Format

### Objectives of the Research

The most important point to lay out is what this research is to be used for, what decisions will be taken as a result, what initial working hypothesis are to be validated/devalidated

The overall objective is to set down the answers to the questions in the Summary of the Brand's Current Situation.

There are four broad areas of investigation

- Consumers' relationship with the category
- Brand Positioning
- Brand Personality
- Brand Expression

Included in the objectives should be any specific problems, issues, areas to probe and what has been learned from other research that would be helpful.

### Sample Composition

It is vital to conduct this amongst the right sample. Great care needs to be taken in defining and recruiting.

This should cover buying or using behaviour, important attitudes or beliefs, lifestyle and/or lifestage, relevant demographics.

Different brand value data will emanate from different consumer groups requiring sensitive interpretation:

- Current Frequent Users/Loyalists
- Current Infrequent Users (perhaps quotas being defined for consumers whose major brands may be key competitors of our brand)
- Lapsed Users (again quota for brands lapsed to may be specified)
- Non-users

### Methodology and Stimulus Material

Focus groups or individual interviews are used most commonly.

These allow a series of projective techniques to be used. BrandAssessor yields the best insights when these techniques are employed to dig into people's real relationship with the brand.

### Examples of Projective Techniques

- Words and pictures
- Personification
- Analogy games
- Psychodrawing
- Role playing

### Stimulus material should be rich and consumer friendly.

- Products/packs, product visuals, if necessary positioning boards, etc.
- A spectrum of key commercials relating to the brand and its key competitors?
- Various materials such as visual/video collages, word association tasks, bubble cartoons, etc.

## The following checklists to help brief in detailed briefing.

### How do consumers relate to the category?

Specifically, the questions we would like the research to answer are :

- What consumers know about the category?
- What they think or feel about it?
- How interested/involved they are in it?
- How they distinguish between different product types, brands, etc.
- When they would buy/use one product/brand rather than another and why?
- What do they look for in this category?
- What stimulates and motivates them?
- What functional values they are looking for?
- What psychological values?

### What is the brand's positioning in their minds?

- What functional/psychological values already belong to our competitors?
- What functional/psychological values does our brand stand for?
- In what fundamental ways is our brand similar to/different from other brands in the market?
- Can a map be drawn in terms of dimensions that define the product field that shows a meaningful relationship between our brand and others?
- What generic values are we appropriating to our brand...
- What discriminating values belong/could belong to our brand?
- Can the functional and psychological components of our brand be bridged into a single core value that we could call the brand's raison d'etre or the brand focus?
- Is this brand focus a matter of absolute coherence or does the brand derive its meaning through a mythic reconciliation of opposites involving Semiotic Analysis ?
- Does the advertising sum up, reflect, and reinforce this brand focus?
- How valuable/relevant/secure/vulnerable is our brand's positioning?

### What is the brand's personality in their minds?

- What is the total impression of our brand, filtered through consumers' predispositions and prejudices?
- What are the factors that have caused this total impression?
- If our brand were a restaurant/a car/an animal, etc., what would it be...
- What would competitor X or competitor Y be?
- If our brand were to come alive, what sort of a person would it be?
- What sort of a person would competitor X or competitor Y be?
- What sort of relationship would consumers have to these persons?
- Is this brand personality a coherent one?
- Does it seem to show a high regard or low regard for the brand...is it reasonably unique?
- If there is a corporate or core brand from which the brand we are working on emanates how will our sub-brand's personality reflect back on the core and vice versa. (This is particularly important with service brands such as banks, etc.)?
- Do consumers differentiate between the brand and the company brand (as increasingly they do with service brands)? What implications does this have for our strategy ?

### Communications Associated with the Brand

This will involve taking the main communication elements of the brand (advertising, packaging and others) and using them as stimulus:

- What do consumers remember about the brand's communications?
- Which of the brand communications seems to have the most meaning for consumers?
- Are there any past executions or associations that are particularly powerful?
- Does the consumer have a clear idea of how the brand communicates with them?
- What are the sorts of things they would expect from the brand and what would be out of character?
- How does the brand's communication differ from its competitors?
