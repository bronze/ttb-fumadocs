title: Communications Associated with the Brand
---

This will involve taking the main communication elements of the brand (advertising, packaging and others) and using them as stimulus:

- What do consumers remember about the brand's communications?
- Which of the brand communications seems to have the most meaning for consumers?
- Are there any past executions or associations that are particularly powerful?
- Does the consumer have a clear idea of how the brand communicates with them?
- What are the sorts of things they would expect from the brand and what would be out of character?
- How does the brand's communication differ from its competitors?

After completing BrandAssessor sm Consumer Research, open up the Current Brand Situation template and fill it in.
