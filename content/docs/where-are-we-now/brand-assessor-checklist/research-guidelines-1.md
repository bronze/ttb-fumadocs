## Research Briefing Format

### Objectives of the Research

The most important point to lay out is what this research is to be used for, what decisions will be taken as a result, what initial working hypothesis are to be validated/devalidated

The overall objective is to set down the answers to the questions in the Summary of the Brand's Current Situation.

There are four broad areas of investigation

- Consumers' relationship with the category
- Brand Positioning
- Brand Personality
- Brand Expression

Included in the objectives should be any specific problems, issues, areas to probe and what has been learned from other research that would be helpful.
