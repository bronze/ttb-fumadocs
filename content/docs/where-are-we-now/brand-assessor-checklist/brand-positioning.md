title: Brand Positioning
---

- What functional/psychological values already belong to our competitors?
- What functional/psychological values does our brand stand for?
- In what fundamental ways is our brand similar to/different from other brands in the market?
- Can a map be drawn in terms of dimensions that define the product field that shows a meaningful relationship between our brand and others?
- What generic values are we appropriating to our brand...
- What discriminating values belong/could belong to our brand?
- Can the functional and psychological components of our brand be bridged into a single core value that we could call the brand's raison d'etre or the brand focus?
- Is this brand focus a matter of absolute coherence or does the brand derive its meaning through a mythic reconciliation of opposites involving Semiotic Analysis ?
- Does the advertising sum up, reflect, and reinforce this brand focus?
- How valuable/relevant/secure/vulnerable is our brand's positioning?
