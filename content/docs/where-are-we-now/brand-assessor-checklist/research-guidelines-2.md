Sample Composition

It is vital to conduct this amongst the right sample. Great care needs to be taken in defining and recruiting.

This should cover buying or using behaviour, important attitudes or beliefs, lifestyle and/or lifestage, relevant demographics.

Different brand value data will emanate from different consumer groups requiring sensitive interpretation:

Current Frequent Users/Loyalists

Current Infrequent Users (perhaps quotas being defined for consumers whose major brands may be key competitors of our brand)

Lapsed Users (again quota for brands lapsed to may be specified)

Non-users

Methodology and Stimulus Material

Focus groups or individual interviews are used most commonly.

These allow a series of projective techniques to be used. BrandAssessor yields the best insights when these techniques are employed to dig into people's real relationship with the brand.

Examples of Projective Techniques

Words and pictures
Personification
Analogy games
Psychodrawing
Role playing
Stimulus material should be rich and consumer friendly.

Products/packs, product visuals, if necessary positioning boards, etc.
A spectrum of key commercials relating to the brand and its key competitors?
Various materials such as visual/video collages, word association tasks, bubble cartoons, etc.
