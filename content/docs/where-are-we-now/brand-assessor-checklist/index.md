title: Brand Assessor & Consumer Research
---

## What it is:

It is a proprietary way of assessing a brand's current value and image with consumers; a rigorous and objective but deep and qualitative assessment based on direct, first hand consumer data that builds on but goes beyond mere "collective wisdom and opinion".

## What its for:

We need it because often existing research will have been done without these specific questions in mind; because often exclusively quantitative methodologies will have been used throwing up just "nice-to-know" but unhelpful sort of data; because often there will be several schools of thought; and finally because often we tend to either grossly overestimate or underestimate the brand's value.

The findings of the BrandAssessor Research should be summarised into a single-page output format called [Current Brand Situation](./brand-assessor-checklist/current-brand). Ideally this should in fact be taken one step further to see if we can capture all this data in the form of _vivid, visual snapshot_ that encapsulates the brand's status quo.

## How to do it

This is divided into two sections

- [Research Guidelines (1)](./brand-assessor-checklist/research-guidelines-1)
- [Research Guidelines (2)](./brand-assessor-checklist/research-guidelines-2)
  The following checklists to help brief in detailed briefing.

- [How do consumers relate to the category?](./brand-assessor-checklist/consumers-vs-category)
- [What is the brand's positioning in their minds?](./brand-assessor-checklist/brand-positioning)
- [What is the brand's personality in their minds?](./brand-assessor-checklist/brand-personality)
- [What communications are associated with the brand?](./brand-assessor-checklist/associated-communications)
