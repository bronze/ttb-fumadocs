title: Brand Personality
---

- What is the total impression of our brand, filtered through consumers' predispositions and prejudices?
- What are the factors that have caused this total impression?
- If our brand were a restaurant/a car/an animal, etc., what would it be...
- What would competitor X or competitor Y be?
- If our brand were to come alive, what sort of a person would it be?
- What sort of a person would competitor X or competitor Y be?
- What sort of relationship would consumers have to these persons?
- Is this brand personality a coherent one?
- Does it seem to show a high regard or low regard for the brand...is it reasonably unique?
- If there is a corporate or core brand from which the brand we are working on emanates how will our sub-brand's personality reflect back on the core and vice versa. (This is particularly important with service brands such as banks, etc.)?
- Do consumers differentiate between the brand and the company brand (as increasingly they do with service brands)? What implications does this have for our strategy ?
