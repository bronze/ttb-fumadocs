title: "Consumers' Relationship with Category"
---

Specifically, the questions we would like the research to answer are :

- What consumers know about the category?
- What they think or feel about it?
- How interested/involved they are in it?
- How they distinguish between different product types, brands, etc.
- When they would buy/use one product/brand rather than another and why?
- What do they look for in this category?
- What stimulates and motivates them?
- What functional values they are looking for?
- What psychological values?
