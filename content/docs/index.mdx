Please select a Client and a Brand by clicking on the required names from the lists opposite. You can also Add, Edit or Delete Clients and Brands from this screen by clicking on the appropriate Client Maintenance or Brand Maintenance buttons. A Logo file can be selected for a Client when you edit the current Client or add a new Client. (Attention: the above is only valid if you're running the original TTB software on a PC - it doesn't work in this TTB Site).

If you would like to find out more about The Thompson Way of Total Branding, see the TTB Overview by clicking on the title below. When you have selected a Client and Brand, or have finished with Maintenance and Master Documents, continue to the rest of the TTB system by clicking the top title.
